/* Macros for handling per-gen compilation.
 *
 * The macro GENX() automatically suffixes whatever you give it with _vX
 *
 * You can do pseudo-runtime checks in your function such as
 *
 * if (PAN_ARCH == 4) {
 *    // Do something
 * }
 *
 * The contents of the if statement must be valid regardless of gen, but
 * the if will get compiled away on everything except first-generation Midgard.
 *
 * For places where you really do have a compile-time conflict, you can
 * use preprocessor logic:
 *
 * #if (PAN_ARCH == 75)
 *    // Do something
 * #endif
 *
 * However, it is strongly recommended that the former be used whenever
 * possible.
